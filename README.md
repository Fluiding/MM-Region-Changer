## Introduction
 You can choose where your matchmaking servers are gonna be located, for example, if you live in East Europe and want to get rid of russians, select anything except for East Europe and you will get queued with the people near the regions you select.

This program works by using your windows firewall to block matchmaking relays/ip addresses.
